  <p>Hi! I'm Lucy, and I write fiction. Though raised in the suburbs of New Jersey, I have spent most of the past ten years in New York City and Shanghai. My stories explore these and other spaces, with special focus on characters who have a shifting sense of what they call "home."</p>
  <p>I recently earned an MFA in Creative Writing from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and my first novel, WHAT WE WERE PROMISED, is forthcoming from Little, Brown (Hachette Book Group) in July 2018. Stories have appeared in journals such as Asia Literary Review, Sixfold, and Ploughshares, where I was fiction winner of the 2015 Emerging Writer's Contest.</p>
  <p>I am currently based in NYC and teach a novel-writing workshop at Catapult. </p>
