  <p>Hi! I'm Lucy, and I write fiction. Though raised in the suburbs of New Jersey, I have spent most of the past ten years in New York City and Shanghai. My stories explore these and other spaces, with special focus on characters who have a shifting sense of what they call "home."</p>
  <p>My debut novel, <%= link_to 'What We Were Promised', book_path, class: 'lt-link' %>, is forthcoming from Little, Brown (Hachette Book Group) on July 10, 2018. Stories have appeared in journals such as <em>Asia Literary Review</em>, <em>Sixfold</em>, and <em>Ploughshares</em>, where I was fiction winner of the 2015 Emerging Writer's Contest. I hold an MFA in creative writing from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and currently teach a novel-writing workshop at <%= link_to 'Catapult', 'https://catapult.co/classes/8-week-novel-writing-workshop-193', class: 'lt-link' %> in New York City.</p>
